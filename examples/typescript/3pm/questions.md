- What is typescript?
A superset of JS. It includes features like type safety and additional syntactic sugar.

- How is it different than compiled languages?
It's transpiled from TS to JS before being executed. It's not converted to machine code until the execution in the engine.

- What is type-safety?
Declaring the data type of a parameter or variable to keep from using the wrong data type. Ensuring proper execution at runtime.

- What is the difference in `tsc` and `npx ts-node`?
tsc transpiles to a JS file. npx ts-node transpiles and executes in a single command.
